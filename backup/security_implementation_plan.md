# Security Implementation Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to address the security issues in the Supabase database.

## Security Issues Identified:

1. **Missing RLS Policies**: Most tables don't have Row Level Security enabled or policies configured
2. **Incomplete Profile Data Protection**: No policies restricting access to profile data
3. **Potential Risks in Security Functions**: Functions need review for secure implementations
4. **Missing Database Triggers**: Not all necessary triggers are in place
5. **Inconsistent Admin Access**: Lack of standardized approach for admin privileges
6. **Nullable Foreign Keys**: Some foreign keys are nullable which can cause security issues
7. **Lack of Public Access Controls**: Missing policies for public access where needed

## Implementation Steps:

### Phase 1: Enable RLS on Tables
- Enable RLS on all tables that store user data
- Verify the impact on existing functionality

### Phase 2: Implement Basic Access Policies
- Add policies for user's own data access
- Add admin access policies

### Phase 3: Enhance Security Functions
- Review and improve the `is_admin_user()` function
- Create additional helper functions for RLS

### Phase 4: Address Foreign Key Issues
- Review nullable foreign keys and address where appropriate

### Phase 5: Define Public Access Controls
- Set up appropriate public access policies where needed

### Phase 6: Test and Validate
- Test all access patterns to ensure functionality
- Verify security controls are working as expected

## Rollback Plan:
If issues arise during implementation, run the backup script from `database_backup.sql` to restore the database to its original state.
