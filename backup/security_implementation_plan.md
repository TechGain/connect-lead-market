# Security Implementation Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to address the security issues in the Supabase database.

## Security Issues Identified:

1. **Missing RLS Policies**: Most tables don't have Row Level Security enabled or policies configured ✅ FIXED
2. **Incomplete Profile Data Protection**: No policies restricting access to profile data ✅ FIXED
3. **Potential Risks in Security Functions**: Functions need review for secure implementations ✅ FIXED
4. **Missing Database Triggers**: Not all necessary triggers are in place ✅ FIXED
5. **Inconsistent Admin Access**: Lack of standardized approach for admin privileges ✅ FIXED
6. **Nullable Foreign Keys**: Some foreign keys are nullable which can cause security issues ⚠️ PARTIALLY FIXED
7. **Lack of Public Access Controls**: Missing policies for public access where needed ✅ FIXED

## Implementation Status:

### ✅ Phase 1: Enable RLS on Tables (COMPLETED)
- RLS enabled on all tables that store user data
- Impact on existing functionality verified

### ✅ Phase 2: Implement Basic Access Policies (COMPLETED)
- Policies added for user's own data access
- Admin access policies implemented
- Role-specific policies applied (buyer/seller)

### ✅ Phase 3: Enhance Security Functions (COMPLETED)
- Improved `is_admin_user()` function with better error handling
- Added `is_buyer()` and `is_seller()` helper functions
- Added `user_has_role()` function for role checks
- Added `is_owner()` helper function

### ✅ Phase 4: Address Foreign Key Issues (PARTIALLY COMPLETED)
- Added validation function for user IDs in leads table
- Some nullable foreign keys remain but validation is in place

### ✅ Phase 5: Define Public Access Controls (COMPLETED)
- Set up appropriate public access policies where needed
- Added specific policies for marketplace functionality

### ✅ Phase 6: Add Data Integrity Triggers (COMPLETED)
- Added trigger to update profile timestamps
- Added trigger to enforce lead status transition rules
- Added trigger to update lead names based on user profiles

## Security Functions Implemented:

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - `is_admin_user()` - Checks if current user has admin role
   - `is_buyer()` - Checks if current user has buyer role
   - `is_seller()` - Checks if current user has seller role
   - `user_has_role(role)` - Checks if current user has specified role
   - `is_owner(record_user_id)` - Checks if current user owns a record

2. **Data Validation**
   - `validate_lead_user_ids()` - Ensures leads reference valid users
   - `track_lead_status_changes()` - Prevents invalid lead status transitions

3. **Data Maintenance**
   - `update_lead_names()` - Keeps lead seller/buyer names in sync with profiles
   - `update_profile_timestamp()` - Updates timestamp on profile changes
   - `prevent_role_change()` - Prevents users from changing their role after creation

## Security Policies Implemented:

1. **Profiles Table**
   - Users can view and update their own profiles
   - Admins can view and update all profiles
   - Only admins can delete profiles
   - New profiles must have valid roles

2. **Leads Table**
   - Sellers can view, insert and update their own leads
   - Buyers can view available leads and their purchased leads
   - Admins have full access to all leads
   - Sellers can only delete unsold leads

3. **Lead Ratings Table**
   - Buyers can rate leads they purchased
   - Sellers can view ratings for their sold leads
   - Admins have full access to all ratings

4. **Chats & Messages Tables**
   - Users can only access their own chats and messages
   - Admins have full access to all chats and messages

## Rollback Plan:
If issues arise during implementation, run the backup script from `database_backup.sql` to restore the database to its original state.

## Next Steps:
1. Monitor application performance with the new security policies
2. Address remaining nullable foreign keys in future updates if needed
3. Consider adding audit logging for sensitive operations
